## Pagination Exercise

A small exercise to practise pagination and continuous scroll

### Tech used: ###
NextJS 14  
Tailwindcss  
Typescript  
MongoDB  

### Deployment: ###
Create an account on [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas)  
Read the MongoDB docs to create a project and within that project connect to a pre-defined database provided by MongoDB which in this case was called 'sample_mflix' and then the collection within the database called 'movies'.  
Clone the repository.  
Run 'npm i' in the terminal to install all packages and dependencies.  
Also create a .env.local file and add in MONGODB_URI and its value - don't forget to put the .env.local into a .gitignore file if publishing.
Once all the above is done, the app can be started locally by running the command 'npm run dev'.
